 C# CLI-Based Text Editor

## Status
 Still not properly working (editing functionality missing) but basic structure for the program already built (I/O, Command Parser, UI)
## Goal
 Aiming to recreate the basic functionalities of a Command Line based text editor having a Nano-like editor as my end-goal.
